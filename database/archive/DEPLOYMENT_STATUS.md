- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)
- Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) 
- Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (BSSE)
- Bachelor of Commerce (BCOM)
- Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT)

### 2. **academic_calendar** (1 record)
- Current academic year: 2024/2025
- Current semester: Semester 1
- Registration and exam dates configured

### 3. **student_fees** (5 records)
- Fee records for all existing students

## 🔧 **Tables Modified**

### 1. **users** table
- ✅ Added `programme_id` (foreign key to programmes)
- ✅ Added `current_semester` (1-8 for 4-year programmes)
- ✅ Added `year_of_study` (1-4)
- ✅ Updated 5 students with programme information

### 2. **courses** table
- ✅ Added `programme_id` (foreign key to programmes)
- ✅ Removed `credit_hours` column (credit system eliminated)
- ✅ Updated 4 courses with programme references

## 🛡️ **Security & Performance**

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ All new tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ Students can only access their own data
- ✅ Admins and deans have appropriate access levels

### Indexes Created
- ✅ Performance indexes on all foreign keys
- ✅ Search indexes on frequently queried columns
- ✅ Unique constraints on critical fields

### Triggers
- ✅ Automatic `updated_at` timestamp management
- ✅ Data integrity enforcement

## 📊 **Data Verification**

### Current Database State
```
programmes: 5 records
academic_calendar: 1 record  
student_fees: 5 records
payment_history: 6 records
users_with_programmes: 5 students
courses_with_programmes: 4 courses
```

### Sample Student Data (Alice Brown)
```
Programme: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
Year of Study: 4
Current Semester: 7
Total Fees: KSh 120,000
Amount Paid: KSh 72,000
Fee Balance: KSh 48,000
Academic Year: 2024/2025

4. **Test course registration** - Ensure unit-based limits work

### Production Readiness
1. **Remove sample data** when deploying to production
2. **Configure real academic calendar** dates
3. **Set up actual fee structures** per programme
4. **Integrate with payment gateways** for real payments

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

✅ **Zero credit references** in entire codebase
✅ **Dynamic data loading** from database
✅ **Proper security policies** implemented
✅ **Performance optimized** with indexes
✅ **Frontend-backend integration** complete

✅ **Fee management system** functional

## 🔍 **Testing Commands**

### Verify Student Data
```sql
SELECT u.full_name, p.title, sf.total_fees, sf.amount_paid 
FROM users u 
JOIN programmes p ON u.programme_id = p.id 
JOIN student_fees sf ON u.auth_id = sf.student_id 
WHERE u.role = 'student';
```

### Check Academic Calendar
```sql
SELECT * FROM academic_calendar WHERE is_current = true;
```

### Verify No Credit References
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE column_name LIKE '%credit%';
-- Should return empty result
```

The MMU LMS backend is now fully prepared to support the frontend with a robust, credit-free, unit-based academic management system! 🎯
