# 🎯 MMU LMS Backend-Frontend Compatibility Summary

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED: Department/Programme Duplication**

The MMU LMS now has **proper separation** between departments and programmes:

### **Before (❌ Problematic)**
- Students/Lecturers had to select BOTH department AND programme
- Department and programme were treated as separate, unrelated fields
- Caused confusion and duplicate data entry
- No clear relationship between academic programmes and organizational departments

### **After (✅ Fixed)**
- **Students & Lecturers**: Select programme → department auto-determined
- **Deans**: Select faculty they head (department = faculty, no separate selection)
- **Admins**: No faculty/department restrictions
- Clear programme-to-department mapping based on real MMU structure

## 🏗️ **Backend Changes Made**

### **1. Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- Added new fields to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN faculty VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN staff_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE;

-- Fixed foreign key reference in session_attachments
ALTER TABLE session_attachments
ADD CONSTRAINT session_attachments_uploaded_by_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (uploaded_by) REFERENCES users(auth_id);

-- Added performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_faculty ON users(faculty);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_staff_id ON users(staff_id);
```

### **2. Complete Programme Data**
- ✅ **30+ Real MMU Programmes** from official website
- ✅ **6 Faculties** with proper programme distribution
- ✅ **Programme-Department Mapping** based on academic structure
- ✅ **All Education Levels**: Certificate, Diploma, Bachelors, Masters

### **3. User Type System**
```typescript
type User = {
  // ... existing fields
  faculty?: string;        // Required for all except admin
  staff_id?: string;       // For lecturers and deans
  programme_id?: string;   // For students and lecturers
  department?: string;     // For deans or auto-determined
}
```

## 🎨 **Frontend Changes Made**

### **1. Registration Form Logic**
```typescript
// Role-based field visibility
- Student/Lecturer: Faculty → Programme → Department (auto)
- Dean: Faculty (department = faculty, no separate selection)
- Admin: No restrictions

// Auto-department determination
handleProgrammeChange(programme) {
  const department = mapProgrammeTodepartment(programme);
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    programme,
    department: (role === 'student' || role === 'lecturer')
      ? department
      : prev.department
  }));
}
```

### **2. Comprehensive Programme Mapping**
```typescript
// Intelligent programme-to-department mapping
if (programme.includes('Computer Science')) {
  department = 'Department of Computer Science';
} else if (programme.includes('Information Technology')) {
  department = 'Department of Information Technology';
}
// ... 15+ mapping rules for all MMU programmes
```

### **3. User Experience Improvements**


- ✅ **Clear Helper Text**: Explains what each field means for each role
- ✅ **Auto-completion**: Department shows automatically after programme selection
- ✅ **Role-specific Validation**: Different requirements for different user types
- ✅ **Real-time Feedback**: Shows selected department below programme field

## 📊 **Data Structure Compatibility**

### **Registration Data Flow**
```javascript
// Frontend sends to backend
const userData = {
  full_name: formData.fullName,
  role: formData.role,
  faculty: formData.faculty,                    // ✅ Now included
  department: formData.department,              // ✅ Auto or manual
  programme_id: formData.programme,             // ✅ For students/lecturers
  student_id: formData.studentId,              // ✅ For students only
  staff_id: generateStaffId(formData.role),    // ✅ For lecturers/deans
};
```

### **Database Relationships**
```
Faculty (1) ──→ (Many) Departments
Faculty (1) ──→ (Many) Programmes
Programme (1) ──→ (1) Department [mapped]
User (1) ──→ (1) Programme [students/lecturers]
User (1) ──→ (1) Department [deans head departments]
```

## 🔐 **Security & Access Control**

### **Row Level Security Updates**
```sql
-- Faculty-based access control
CREATE POLICY "Users can read faculty members" ON users
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth_id = auth.uid() OR
  faculty IN (SELECT faculty FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
);
```

### **Data Validation**
- ✅ **Faculty required** for all roles except admin
- ✅ **Programme required** for students and lecturers
- ✅ **Department required** for deans
- ✅ **Proper foreign key constraints** ensure data integrity

## 🚀 **Migration Scripts Created**

### **1. `migrate_backend_compatibility.sql`**
- Updates existing database schema
- Adds missing columns and indexes
- Fixes foreign key references
- Updates existing user data

### **2. `populate_mmu_programmes.sql`**
- Removes old sample data
- Adds all real MMU programmes
- Maps programmes to correct departments
- Updates user-faculty relationships

### **3. `BACKEND_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE.md`**
- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Verification queries
- Troubleshooting guide
- Success indicators

## ✅ **Testing & Verification**

### **Registration Flow Testing**
- ✅ **Student Registration**: Faculty → Programme → Auto Department
- ✅ **Lecturer Registration**: Faculty → Programme → Auto Department
- ✅ **Dean Registration**: Faculty Selection (department = faculty automatically)
- ✅ **Admin Registration**: No faculty/department restrictions

### **Data Integrity Checks**
```sql
-- Verify all users have faculty (except admins)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE faculty IS NULL AND role != 'admin' AND is_active = true;
-- Should return 0

-- Verify programme-department mapping
SELECT DISTINCT faculty, department, COUNT(*)
FROM programmes
GROUP BY faculty, department;
-- Should show proper distribution
```
