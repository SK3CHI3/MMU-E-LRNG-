## 🏗️ Database Schema Design

### Users Table
```sql
users (
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email: VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  password_hash: VARCHAR,
  role: ENUM('student', 'lecturer', 'dean', 'admin'),
  faculty_id: UUID (NULL for admin),
  department_id: UUID (NULL for admin/dean),
  is_active: BOOLEAN,
  created_at: TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Role-Specific Tables
```sql
students (
  user_id: UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  student_number: VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  program_id: UUID,
  year_of_study: INTEGER,
  enrollment_date: DATE
)

lecturers (
  user_id: UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  employee_id: VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  department_id: UUID,
  specialization: VARCHAR,
  hire_date: DATE
)

deans (
  user_id: UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  faculty_id: UUID,
  appointment_date: DATE
)

admins (
  user_id: UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  admin_level: ENUM('super', 'system', 'support')
)
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization Flow

### 1. Login Process
```typescript
1. User enters credentials
2. Verify email/password
3. Fetch user role and permissions
4. Generate JWT with role claims
5. Redirect to appropriate dashboard
```

### 2. Route Protection
```typescript
// Route guards for each role
/dashboard/student/* - Requires 'student' role
/dashboard/lecturer/* - Requires 'lecturer' role
/dashboard/dean/* - Requires 'dean' role
/dashboard/admin/* - Requires 'admin' role
```

### 3. Component-Level Security
```typescript
// Permission-based component rendering
<CanAccess permission="manage_courses">
  <CourseManagement />
</CanAccess>
```

## 📱 Dashboard Routing Structure

```

│   ├── /assignments
│   ├── /grades
│   ├── /schedule
│   └── /resources
├── /lecturer
│   ├── /courses
│   ├── /students
│   ├── /grading

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

### Color Coding by Role
- **Student**: Blue theme (learning focus)
- **Lecturer**: Green theme (teaching focus)
- **Dean**: Purple theme (management focus)
- **Admin**: Red theme (system control)

### Navigation Differences
- **Student**: Course-centric navigation
- **Lecturer**: Teaching tools focus
- **Dean**: Faculty management tools
- **Admin**: System administration tools

## 🔄 Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core RBAC
1. Update authentication system
2. Create role-based routing
3. Implement permission checks
4. Create basic dashboards

### Phase 2: Role-Specific Features
1. Student dashboard & features
2. Lecturer dashboard & tools
3. Dean oversight capabilities
4. Admin management interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Cross-role communication
2. Advanced analytics
3. Workflow approvals
4. Audit logging

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
- Students: Only own data
- Lecturers: Only assigned courses
- Deans: Only faculty data
- Admins: All data with audit trails

### API Security
- Role-based endpoint access
- Data filtering by permissions
- Request validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive audit logging

This design ensures proper separation of concerns while maintaining security and usability for each user type.
